2048 is a game played on a 4x4 board, the cells of which contain the numbers 0 and powers of 2 (powers from 1 to 11). The goal is to get 2048 (power of 11). The player can move the entire board left, right, up and down, summing up the values ​​of adjacent cells. If the player gets 2048, he wins. If all the cells contain numbers 2 or higher, and the values ​​do not sum up after the move attempt, the game ends.
